# Changelog

All notable changes to the Alarm.com Home Assistant integration will be documented in this file.

---
## 2026.3.21

Builds on 2026.3.18.2 with camera support, a full bug fix pass across all platforms, and HACS readiness improvements.

### Added
- **Camera support**: WebRTC live-streaming for Alarm.com cameras via a custom Lovelace card (`www/alarm-webrtc-card.js`)
- Camera entities automatically refresh WebRTC tokens every 45 minutes so streams are always ready without manual intervention
- Still image snapshots now supported — camera thumbnails display correctly in the HA media browser and picture-glance dashboard cards
- `brand/logo.png` added for HACS integration detail page display
- `info.md` added for HACS store listing

### Fixed

#### Platforms
- **Thermostat**: `async_set_temperature` was silently doing nothing — it read `kwargs.get("target_temp")` but HA sends `"temperature"` (`ATTR_TEMPERATURE`). Single-target temperature changes now work correctly
- **Thermostat**: High/low setpoints now sent in a single API call instead of two sequential calls, avoiding potential race conditions and rate limiting
- **Thermostat**: Fixed mismatched `# fmt: off` / `# fmt: on` comment pair in `initiate_state`
- **Lock**: `code_format_fn` now correctly returns `CodeFormat.NUMBER` / `CodeFormat.TEXT` instead of raw regex strings that HA doesn't understand, fixing silent failure of lock code format enforcement
- **Lock**: Removed `import re` buried inside a function body — moved to top-level import
- **Alarm Panel**: Removed duplicate arm code validation that ran twice on every arm/disarm command (once silently, once raising an exception)
- **Cover**: Gates now correctly use `CoverDeviceClass.GATE` instead of `CoverDeviceClass.GARAGE` — gate entities now show the correct icon and label in HA
- **Entity**: Removed unreachable duplicate `return device_info` statement in `device_info_fn`

#### Infrastructure
- **Orphan cleanup** (`util.py`): Entities without a `unique_id` were incorrectly deleted on every HA restart because the match condition was inverted. They are now matched solely by `entity_id` as intended
- **Camera session** (`camera_api.py`): Auth retries now only trigger on HTTP 401/403 responses instead of catching all exceptions blindly
- **Camera import** (`__init__.py`): Fixed `NameError` — `CONF_MFA_TOKEN`, `CONF_USERNAME`, and `CONF_PASSWORD` were referenced before being imported
- **Config flow** (`config_flow.py`): Replaced deprecated `async_timeout` package (removed in HA 2024.x) with `asyncio.timeout`

#### Lovelace Card (`www/alarm-webrtc-card.js`)
- Fixed `visibilitychange` event listener leak — a new listener was added on every stream restart and never removed. Listeners are now stored and cleaned up in `disconnectedCallback`
- Fixed `_requesting` flag deadlock — if HA never responded to a `camera.turn_on` call the card would freeze on "Refreshing session..." indefinitely. A 15-second safety timeout now resets the flag automatically
- `callService` failures now immediately reset `_requesting` instead of leaving the card frozen

### Improved
- Camera session reuses the authenticated `pyalarmdotcomajax` HTTP session where possible, avoiding a second full login on every HA startup. Falls back gracefully to an independent login if session internals are not accessible
- README updated with full camera setup instructions, Lovelace card configuration example, and camera added to supported devices table
- Camera removed from roadmap in README since it is now implemented
- Cleaned up dead commented-out platform stubs (`Platform.NUMBER`, `Platform.SWITCH`, `Platform.SELECT`) from `const.py`

## 2026.3.18.2

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where one-time password (OTP) was not sent during initial login when only a single 2FA method was available
- Fixed config flow skipping OTP request step, causing users to be stuck on verification screen
- Corrected OTP handling logic to properly request codes for SMS and email methods

### Improved
- Enhanced multi-factor authentication flow to handle all supported Alarm.com verification methods correctly
- Added safeguards for lost or invalid OTP method state during login
- Improved error handling and user feedback during authentication process
- Updated device registry identifiers to ensure compatibility with Home Assistant requirements

### Changed
- Updated pyalarmdotcomajax dependency to custom GitHub version with OTP fixes
- Cleaned up config flow logic for better reliability and maintainability

### Other
- Reordered manifest.json fields to meet Home Assistant and hassfest validation requirements
- General code cleanup and logging improvements

## 2026.3.16

Expanded Alarm.com entity coverage with new diagnostic sensors, system actions, trouble reporting, and bypass services.

### Added

- Added Home Assistant `sensor` platform to the integration
- Added diagnostic battery percentage sensors where Alarm.com exposes battery data
- Added diagnostic battery status enum sensors where Alarm.com exposes battery classification data
- Added diagnostic bypass state binary sensors for supported sensors
- Added system action buttons:
  - Stop Alarms
  - Clear Alarms In Memory
- Added smoke reset button support for smoke detector resources
- Added system-level trouble condition binary sensors
- Added per-device trouble mapping binary sensors
- Added `alarmdotcom.bypass_sensor` and `alarmdotcom.unbypass_sensor` services
- Added `services.yaml` definitions for the new bypass services

### Improved

- Expanded diagnostic visibility for Alarm.com systems and managed devices
- Integration now surfaces additional diagnostic and system state information
- Improved cleanup handling for newly created sensor entities
- Included the new `sensor` platform in the integration platform loader

### Dependency Updates

- Updated `pyalarmdotcomajax` dependency to `2026.3.15`
- Integration now pulls the library directly from the GitHub tag to ensure compatibility

### Notes

- Battery percentage and battery status only appear for device types where Alarm.com returns usable battery data
- Many panel sensors currently report no battery value and no bypass capability through the available Alarm.com payloads
- Bypass services will only work for sensors where Alarm.com reports `supportsBypass: true`

- Updated codebase for compatibility with recent Home Assistant versions
- Initial repository structure cleanup and documentation improvements

### Improved

- Improved reliability and entity initialization
- Updated internal structure to better align with modern Home Assistant integration patterns
