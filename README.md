# Maintained Fork

This repository is an actively maintained fork of the original **Alarm.com for Home Assistant** integration.

The goal of this fork is to maintain compatibility with modern Home Assistant releases while continuing development of the Alarm.com integration as the Home Assistant platform evolves.

Recent Home Assistant updates introduced architectural changes that affect older integrations. This fork adapts the integration to those changes and ensures continued functionality, including compliance with the Home Assistant device registry enforcement requirements introduced in Home Assistant 2025.12.

Repository and issue tracker:

https://github.com/ibasebcast/ha-alarmdotcom

The maintainer of this fork operates Alarm.com systems professionally and has access to multiple Alarm.com environments, allowing testing across a wider variety of devices and system configurations.

Community feedback, testing, and contributions are welcome.

**Chris Pulliam**
GitHub: https://github.com/ibasebcast

The goal of this project is to ensure the Alarm.com ecosystem remains usable within Home Assistant as the platform evolves.

This fork exists to provide:

* Continued compatibility with new Home Assistant versions
* Expanded device support
* Improved reliability and error handling
* Long-term maintenance of the integration

# Overview

This custom component allows Home Assistant to interface with **Alarm.com** using the Alarm.com web platform.

The integration focuses primarily on Alarm.com security system functionality and requires an Alarm.com service package that includes security system support.

Because this integration communicates with Alarm.com cloud services, functionality may change if Alarm.com modifies their platform.

---

# Safety Notice

This integration is designed for **convenience and automation**, but it should **not be relied upon for safety-critical functions.**

Reasons include:

1. This integration communicates with Alarm.com using unofficial endpoints.
2. Alarm.com status updates may take time to propagate.
3. Home Assistant automations may introduce unintended behavior.
4. This code is community developed and may contain bugs.

For critical alerts such as:

* Break-ins
* Fire
* Carbon monoxide
* Water leaks
* Freeze warnings

You should rely on **Alarm.com's official monitoring services and mobile applications.**

Where possible, use **locally controlled Home Assistant integrations** for automation. Local integrations continue functioning during internet outages, while this integration requires cloud communication.
